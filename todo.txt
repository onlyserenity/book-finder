OBJECTIVES
Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books. 
You may need to signup with google to get a API key; 
read the documentation for more information.

REQUIREMENTS
This application should allow you to:
- Enter a query in a search box
- Display a list of books matching the given query.
- Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, 
    as well as a picture of the book.
- From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, 
    but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. 
    In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
