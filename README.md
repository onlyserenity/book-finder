# Book Finder with Google Book API [(LIVE)](https://welcomeying.github.io/book-finder/)
The project is part of chingu | Voyage-8

### OBJECTIVES
Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books. You may need to signup with google to get a API key; read the documentation for more information.

### REQUIREMENTS
This application should allow you to:
- Enter a query in a search box
- Display a list of books matching the given query.
- Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
- From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
